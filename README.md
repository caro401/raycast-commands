# Raycast script commands

I use [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) as a launcher on all my computers that it supports. Raycast allows you to write [script commands](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands) to do the little things you do often. Here's the ones I use.

Use this yourself [as described here](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands#install-script-commands-from-this-repository) - clone, then set the cloned directory as a scripts directory.

## Clone a git repo using `ghq`

I manage my local repositories using [ghq](https://github.com/x-motemen/ghq). This script saves me opening a terminal to clone a new repo, I just need to supply the user/org and repo name to grab any repo I have access to on github to a sensible place on my local filesystem.
